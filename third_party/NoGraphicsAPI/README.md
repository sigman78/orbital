# NoGraphicsAPI

`NoGraphicsAPI` is an experimental Vulkan 1.4 implementation of the ideas in Sebastian Aaltonen's
[*No Graphics API*](https://www.sebastianaaltonen.com/blog/no-graphics-api). It explores how much of
a conventional graphics API disappears when shaders use 64-bit GPU pointers, texture and sampler
descriptors live in application-owned GPU memory, and synchronization describes hazards instead of
resource state.

The Vulkan backend is implemented and exercised by three example applications. Metal support is not
implemented; [the Metal 4 design](docs/metal-porting.md) records the proposed mapping and open issues.

## How it maps to *No Graphics API*

- **GPU pointers replace buffer objects and bindings.** `create_gpu_heap()` returns a raw allocation
  with a GPU address and, for mapped memory, a CPU address. Address-based commands consume
  `GpuRange {gpu, size}` directly, and shaders follow typed 64-bit pointers for vertex fetch and
  arbitrary data structures.
- **Applications own descriptor heaps.** Texture and sampler descriptor heaps are mapped GPU heaps.
  The application chooses slots, writes descriptors through the CPU address, binds the GPU range,
  and passes 32-bit indices to shaders.
- **Root data is one small payload.** A shared C++/Slang structure is copied with
  `vkCmdPushDataEXT` for each draw or dispatch. Its pointer fields are GPU addresses. Unlike the
  blog's GPU-resident, stage-specific roots, graphics stages share one CPU-supplied root.
- **Barriers describe execution and memory hazards.** The public API exposes global stage/access
  barriers, not per-resource transition lists. Normal textures remain in one unified layout.
- **Pipeline binding state stays small.** There are no public buffer objects, descriptor sets,
  descriptor layouts, pipeline layouts, or sampler objects. Viewport, scissor, and exposed
  depth/stencil behavior are command state rather than PSO permutations, while data arrives through the root and descriptor heaps.
- **Submission is explicit and asynchronous.** Applications provide timeline points for reuse and
  deferred destruction. Submitted command buffers are one-shot.

The [design comparison](docs/no-graphics-api-comparison.md) separates faithful mappings, Vulkan-driven
differences, and features that remain outside the prototype.

## Vulkan realization

The backend intentionally creates no `VkDescriptorSetLayout`, `VkDescriptorPool`, `VkDescriptorSet`,
or `VkPipelineLayout`. Its central extensions are:

- `VK_EXT_descriptor_heap` for application-owned resource/sampler heaps and `vkCmdPushDataEXT`;
- `VK_KHR_device_address_commands` for address-based index, indirect, and copy commands;
- `VK_KHR_shader_untyped_pointers` as the descriptor-heap SPIR-V prerequisite;
- `VK_KHR_unified_image_layouts`, when available, to optimize ordinary texture access in
  `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL`;
- `VK_EXT_mesh_shader` for mesh pipelines and dispatch.

NoGraphicsAPI is a low-level, thin Vulkan wrapper. Debug builds enable `VK_EXT_debug_utils` and the
Khronos validation layer when available.

Vulkan 1.4 supplies buffer device addresses, timeline semaphores, dynamic rendering,
synchronization2, scalar block layout, and the remaining core features. See
[Vulkan support](docs/vulkan-support.md) for the concise feature and command mapping.

## GPU memory and descriptor heaps

There are no public buffer objects or internal suballocators. Applications own data and descriptor
heaps; optimal-tiled textures use separate GPU-only heaps. The optional utility library provides
application-side data and texture allocation policies.

`GpuRange` is the non-owning address/size view used by commands. Texture and sampler descriptors are
addressed in Slang through the standard heap syntax:

```slang
Texture2D<float4> texture = ResourceDescriptorHeap[texture_index];
SamplerState sampler = SamplerDescriptorHeap[sampler_index];
float4 texel = texture.Sample(sampler, uv);
```

## Shared root ABI

Shared scalar, vector, and matrix types come from `<NoGraphicsAPIUtility/shader_types.h>`. Root
structures are declared once and included by C++ and Slang:

```cpp
struct RootArguments
{
    Vertex* vertices;
    float4x4 mvp;
};
```

On the CPU, pointer fields receive GPU virtual addresses while ordinary values are copied directly:

```cpp
GpuCpuRange<Vertex> vertex_memory = bump_allocator.allocate<Vertex>(vertex_count);
RootArguments root{
    .vertices = vertex_memory.gpu,
    .mvp = mvp,
};
gpu::draw(commands, root, vertex_count);
```

Slang declares the same root as push-constant data and reads both pointer and value fields directly:

```slang
[[vk::push_constant]] ConstantBuffer<RootArguments> root;

Vertex vertex = root.vertices[vertex_id];
float4x4 mvp = root.mvp;
```

The draw or dispatch copies the root bytes immediately through `vkCmdPushDataEXT`; the root does not
need to outlive the call. Shared structures use C layout, and matrix-bearing roots use row-major matrix
layout. Root values must be trivially copyable, have a size divisible by four, and be no larger than
`DeviceCaps::max_push_data_size`.

Public descriptor structures have useful defaults. Call sites use C++20 designated initializers to
name only fields that differ from those defaults. `Span` and `ByteSpan` are non-owning pointer/count
views used for function inputs.

The full shader-side contract is in the [Slang shader contract](docs/slang.md).

## Build and run

Requirements:

- CMake 3.24+, a C++20 compiler, and Vulkan SDK headers and development libraries version 1.4.357
  or newer;
- a little-endian x86-64 target; the optional utility math target additionally requires AVX2 and FMA;
- a Vulkan 1.4 loader and device exposing the required descriptor-heap, device-address-command,
  untyped-pointer, and mesh extensions above, plus their required BDA, synchronization, and
  16-bit/scalar-layout features;
- coherent CPU-visible GPU memory through a PCIe BAR on a discrete GPU or UMA on an integrated GPU,
  plus device-local memory compatible with the supported buffers and textures;
- Slang 2026.14.1+ and SPIRV-Tools 2026.3+ when building the examples.

MSVC and clang-cl are supported on Windows. GNU and Clang can build the headless library on other
platforms. MinGW, 32-bit x86, and ARM targets are not supported.

The utility implementation is shipped in-tree, so configuration has no Git or network dependency.
The default configuration builds NoGraphicsAPI and its companion utility library. Examples and tests
are opt-in so embedding NoGraphicsAPI with `add_subdirectory()` does not add development targets:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
cmake --install build --prefix path/to/install
```

The same install provides independent `NoGraphicsAPI` and `NoGraphicsAPIUtility` packages:

```cmake
find_package(NoGraphicsAPI CONFIG REQUIRED)
find_package(NoGraphicsAPIUtility CONFIG REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(my_application PRIVATE
    NoGraphicsAPI::NoGraphicsAPI
    NoGraphicsAPIUtility::math
    NoGraphicsAPIUtility::textures)
```

NoGraphicsAPIUtility provides shared C++/Slang types, math, data and texture suballocation, and a
timeline-driven `DeleteQueue`. These are optional application-side policies; NoGraphicsAPI does not
depend on them. The queue delays allocator reuse and resource destruction until the application
timeline completes. `BumpAllocator::allocate_atomic()` supports relaxed-atomic concurrent reservations from worker threads.

For repository development on Windows, enable the examples and tests explicitly. Building examples
requires the Slang and SPIR-V Tools versions listed above.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DNOGRAPHICSAPI_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON -DNOGRAPHICSAPI_BUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

The Windows examples use the normal swapchain path:

- [`triangle`](examples/triangle/triangle.cpp): the minimum vertex/fragment draw and presentation path;
- [`cube`](examples/cube/cube.cpp): typed GPU-pointer vertex fetch plus application-owned texture and
  sampler heaps;
- [`deferred_renderer`](examples/deferred_renderer/deferred_renderer.cpp): GPU-compute simulation and
  mesh-shader rendering in a multi-pass workload with pointer-based scene data, barriers between
  passes, and timeline-managed CPU/GPU overlap.

They can be run from their corresponding directories under `build/examples` when
`NOGRAPHICSAPI_BUILD_EXAMPLES` is enabled.

## Hardware support

Driver support was checked on 5 September 2026 against the latest available packages; linked reports
are representative snapshots. `create_device()` remains authoritative; Vulkan 1.4 alone does not
provide the required new extensions.

The latest available Windows drivers are [AMD Adrenalin 26.9.1](https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/release-notes/RN-RAD-WIN-26-9-1.html)
and [NVIDIA 616.64 WHQL](https://us.download.nvidia.com/Windows/616.64/616.64-win11-win10-release-notes.pdf).

🔴 marks missing required extensions or a capacity-limited fixed BAR. All checked ReBAR GPUs expose
their main VRAM heap as CPU-visible; availability depends on platform firmware. A fixed BAR can still
satisfy the memory requirement, but limits the default CPU-visible heaps; GPU-only allocations
can use separate VRAM.

Checked UMA heap sizes are 5.1 GiB on a Windows
[Radeon 680M](https://vulkan.gpuinfo.org/displayreport.php?id=47714), 5.8 GiB on
[Steam Deck](https://vulkan.gpuinfo.org/displayreport.php?id=51189), and 21.2 GiB on a Windows
[Radeon 780M](https://vulkan.gpuinfo.org/displayreport.php?id=49646); they vary with system configuration.

Current Windows RDNA 2 reports lack `VK_EXT_descriptor_heap`; the checked RDNA 3 and RDNA 4 AMD GPUs
and all listed NVIDIA GPUs advertise every required extension. With Mesa
[RADV 26.2 or newer](https://docs.mesa3d.org/relnotes/26.2.0.html), Steam Deck also has all required
extensions. Linux/SteamOS window presentation is not implemented yet and is planned for a near-term update.

🔴 [Pascal / GeForce GTX 10](https://vulkan.gpuinfo.org/displayreport.php?id=51084) is below the NVIDIA
floor: it lacks all four new extensions and exposes a 214 MiB fixed BAR.

Intel Windows support is not verified. The latest public
[Arc report](https://vulkan.gpuinfo.org/displayreport.php?id=51355) lacks the descriptor-heap,
device-address-command, and shader-untyped-pointer extensions. Mesa ANV
[26.2 or newer](https://docs.mesa3d.org/relnotes/26.2.0.html) exposes the required extensions on Linux,
but this repository currently lacks Linux swap chain support (to be implemented).

## Current scope

The library has been reviewed with GPT-6 Astra Ultra, but remains a prototype and may contain bugs. Please report issues.

Implemented today: graphics, mesh, and compute PSOs; direct and indirect work; GPU-address copies;
application-owned descriptor heaps; common texture types and views; dynamic rendering and
viewport/scissor/depth-stencil state; global barriers; timeline submission; deferred destruction; and Win32 presentation.

This is a deliberately single-threaded, single-queue graphics API. Ray tracing, task shaders, sparse memory,
device-generated command graphs beyond the existing indirect operations, pipeline caching, MSAA, non-Win32
presentation, and a Metal backend are outside the current implementation. The public header remains the source
of truth for the exact API surface.
